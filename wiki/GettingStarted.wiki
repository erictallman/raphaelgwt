= Getting Started =

Download the source distribution and extract in your project root.

== Using RaphaelGWT in your project ==

To your module XML file, add:

{{{
    <inherits name='com.hydro4ge.raphaelgwt.RaphaelGWT' />
}}}


Add the following in the document head of your module HTML file:

{{{
    <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="<module>/raphael-min.js"></script>
}}}

Since the RaphaelGWT module includes both the full and minified versions of the Raphael Javascript sources, you can trim the "-min" for debugging purposes.

== Viewing a Demo ==

Change into the `samples/<demo>` directory, define the environment variable `GWTPATH=/path/to/gwt-2.0.0`, and run `ant devmode` to see it in action.
